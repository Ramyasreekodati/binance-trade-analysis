1. 

dataset contains 150 rows and 2 columns:

Port_IDs (integer type) - This column has no missing values (150 non-null).

Trade_History (object type) - This column has one missing value (149 non-null).


The dataset uses around 2.5 KB of memory.

2. 

Dataset Structure:

150 rows, 2 columns (Port_IDs, Trade_History).

Port_IDs is int64, meaning it's correctly formatted.

Trade_History is object (string-like JSON data) and will need parsing.

Trade_History has 1 missing value.

3. 

time            :        Trade timestamp (convert to datetime).
symbol          :        Traded asset (e.g., BTCUSDT).
side            :        BUY/SELL action.
price           :        Execution price.
quantity        :        Money involved in the trade.
realizedProfit  :        Profit/loss from the trade.

4. 

First 5 Rows Analysis:
Trade_History contains JSON-like structures, meaning each row holds a list of trades for an account.
We need to extract details like time, symbol, side (BUY/SELL), price, and quantity.

5. 

Missing Values:
Only 1 missing value in Trade_History, which is minor.
We can drop or fill this value, depending on requirements.

                                   ## Use returns.mean() / returns.std().

MDD (Maximum Drawdown)      =     Compute peak-to-trough drop using cummax() and min().

Total Positions             :       Count total trades.
Win Positions               :       Count trades with realizedProfit > 0.
Win Rate                    :       Win Positions / Total Positions.
PnL (Profit & Loss)         :       Sum of realizedProfit.
MDD (Maximum Drawdown)      :       Largest peak-to-trough loss in the trade sequence.
